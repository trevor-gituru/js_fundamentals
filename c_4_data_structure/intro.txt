Numbers, strings and boolean can be cosidered the atoms of programming
However some data structures require more complex information
Hence objects(molecules) are introduced which can group together different data
types as well as objects
We will look into a project known as weresquirrel
An individual, let as say A, from time to time transforms into a weresquirrel
between 8pm-10pm.He is keeping a journal of day-day things to find out what causes
the transformation.
