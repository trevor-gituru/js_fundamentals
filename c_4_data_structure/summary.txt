//Objects and arrays are similar to containing multiple values in a single one
//It is instead of holding each value in a small bag one uses a larger bag to hold
//all of them
//Most values have properties with the exception of empty values
//They can be accessed as value.property_name, value["property name"]
//Objects tend to use names as their property
//Arrays use index of their property as their names
//Methods are functions that live in properties and usually act on the value they
are property of
//To iterate over an array one can use a specail for -loop (let element of array )
