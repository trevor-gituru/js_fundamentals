/*Every value has a property except empty value.One can imagine that each value is a
character in the game, accessing their properties is like accessing the
characters/profile/attributes panel which give more info about the character
To access the property of a value one uses the dot or [].The name after the dot
is the property one is trying to access. While use of square brackets is to access
one of the elements that make up the value
*/
/*
Elements in an array are stored as property. The property names are usually the
index hence the only way to access them is to use [index]*/
//Dot notation works with binding names
let h = [1,2,3,4];
console.log(h["length"]);
