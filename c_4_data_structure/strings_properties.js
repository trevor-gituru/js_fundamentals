//Strings,numbers and boolean are immutaeble hence one cannot add properties to them
//But they come with a copuple inbuilt methods such as indexOf, slice

console.log("one two three".indexOf("ee"));
// â†’ 11

//Join is an array method to join its elements into a string with a specific character
//used in between each element
console.log(word.join(" "));
//A string can be repeated a predetermined number of times to form a new Strings
// as a return value
console.log("PA".repeat(4));
//THere is also length to find total number of character in astringg and accessing
